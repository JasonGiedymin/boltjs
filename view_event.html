<h1>Event Handling</h1>

<p>
  All Bolt <b>View</b>s have a <b>listen</b> method which can be used to listen for both DOM and custom events.  Simply pass the event name and the function callback.  The callback can be either a function or a string, in which case it is the name of a function on the <b>View</b>s owner.  (For more information on the Owner concept, see <a href="view_building.html">Building Views</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The example below shows the case where the listen function is passed a function.  Note that the event name does not contain 'on', this is important.  The <b>event</b> parameter passed to the callback is a <a href="http://javelinjs.com">Javelin</a> event, not a standard DOM event.  This provides a number of extra functions that you can see in the <a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/javelin/class/JX.Event.html">Javelin Docs</a>.  To get the original DOM event, call <b>event.getRawEvent()</b>.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
  var Button = require('views/Button').Button;
  var myButton = new Button();
  myButton.listen('mouseover', function(event) {
    console.log('mouseover event');
  });
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Using the Builder</h2>

<p>
  It is also possible to attach events when using the <a href="view_building.html">Builder</a>.  Any property set on a view passed the Builder that starts with <b>on</b> is assumed to be an event and is listened to.  The example below shows a simple version of this in use.  Note that unlike when calling the <b>listen</b> method directly, the event name begins with <b>on</b>.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
  var Button = require('views/Button').Button;
  var myButton = builder.build({
    view: Button,
    onmouseover: function(event) {
      console.log('mouseover event');
    }
  });
{% endhighlight %}
